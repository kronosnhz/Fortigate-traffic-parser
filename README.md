# Fortigate-traffic-parser
Script to parse the `raw` column of the CSV generated by Lookwise SIEM about Fortigate Firewall traffic logs.

# How to run
1. Execute the query in Lookwise selecting a traffic interval
1. Download the CSV file from Lookwise
1. Execute `py traffic-parser <filename>.csv`

The script will create a new file ending with `_parsed.csv` with the most relevant fields.

# How to add/remove fields to be parsed
By default the script is made to extract `srcip` `srcport` `dstip` `dstport` `service` but it can be customized with other fields. Copy the lines where those are found using regex and change the attribute to find,also remember to add the column label in the generation of the header row.
